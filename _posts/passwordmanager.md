# Password Managers

There are many password managers available on the internet.  But which one should you use?  What should you look for?  Is there one that works for everybody?

The answer to all of those questions depends on your needs.  Every password manager out there has its pluses and minuses.  Some are free, some cost money, some are open source (what does that even mean?).  In this article I will talk about all of that.

We will discuss

* Why do I need a password manager?
* How to choose a password manager
* How to install the password manager you choose
* How to install the brower plugin for the password manager you choose
* How to get your existing passwords into the password manager
* How to create new passwords and store them in your password manager
* How to export your data and change password managers

There are always new password managers coming out.  So this article might be dated quickly.  But I will cover the basic concepts at the time or writing, and those should carry through to the latest and greatest.

Hopefully this article will help you get started.
